                High-level programming language
                Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Wikipedia
                Designed by: James Gosling
                First appeared: May 23, 1995; 29 years ago
                Paradigm: Multi-paradigm: generic, object-oriented (class-based), functional, imperative, reflective, concurrent</p>

                James Gosling, the creator of Java, in 2008
                James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[21] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[22] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[23] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[24]
                
                Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[25] It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[26] With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <p>
                There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]
                
                It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
                It must be robust and secure.
                It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
                It must execute with high performance.
                It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</p>

            <h2>Versions</h2>
            <p>Main article: Java version history
                As of September 2023, Java 8, 11, 17 and 21 are supported as Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.[38]
                
                Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors such as Adoptium continue to offer free builds of OpenJDK's Long-Term Support (LTS) versions. These builds may include additional security patches and bug fixes.[39]</p>
